# Machine_Learning_AQI_Project
Problem Statement:
      Prediciting the Air quality index(AQI) of Banglore city based on the daily weather report of the city
      
Algorithms used:-
               
     1. Linear Regression
     2. Ridge Regression
     3. Lasso Regression
     4. Decision Tree
     5. Random Forset
     6. Xg Boost

Xg Boost Algorithm gave a better result compared to other algorithms.
